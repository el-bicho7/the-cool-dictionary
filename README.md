# The Cool Dictionary 

AS A USER, I want to know the meaning of a word, as it's synonym and antonym.

As a user...
When I start the application
I will see a welcome page where I can enter "the word" of which I want to know its meaning, synonyms and antonyms.  
I will see an auto-fill input field with the last searched words (up to 24).
I will see a "SEARCH" button where I can CLICK once I have typed the word.
If the word is not valid I will see a "CAUTION to correct or change the word and [I may see a "similar" word with the message "Did you mean "this"?]
If the word is accepted, I will see a "SEARCHING" message and then see the results for meaning, synonyms and antonyms.
